## 🧩 Agents Flow & Orchestration

MindCare AI uses a **multi-agent orchestration pipeline**:

1. **Frontend (React + Vite)**  
   - Sends user input and chat history to backend (`/chat/respond`).  
   - Displays responses with persona avatars, colors, timestamps.  

2. **Backend (FastAPI + Agents)**  
   - **Chat Agent (`chat_agent.py`)**  
     - Orchestrates conversation flow.  
     - Decides which persona should respond (CBT, Holistic, Analytical).  
     - Formats messages with timestamps + typing delays.  
   - **Crisis Detector (`crisis_detector.py`)**  
     - If crisis keywords found → inserts emergency message + helpline card.  
   - **Wellness Agent (`wellness_agent.py`)**  
     - If stress/anxiety detected → adds breathing card with visual guidance.  

3. **OpenAI Integration**  
   - Each persona has a **system prompt** guiding its philosophy.  
   - Messages include context + user’s history.  
   - AI generates responses in **persona-specific style**.  

4. **Orchestration Loop**  
   - User sends message →  
   - Crisis/Wellness checks →  
   - Selected AI persona replies →  
   - Frontend enqueues response with delay →  
   - UI displays conversation as if it were real-time.
